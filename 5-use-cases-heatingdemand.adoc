=== Building Heating demand simulation and visualization

==== Description

This use case is about using 3D city models to simulate the building's heating demand and visualize the results in a web-based 3D scene. Why is this relevant? The building sector has a large potential in the EU economy for energy efficiency gains and CO2-reductions and is thus a priority area for achievement of the ambitious climate and energy targets for 2020 and 2050 [1]. In order to reach a 2% energy refurbishment rate promoted by the European Union and to realise long-term climate neutral communities, information about the current and future demand is necessary to develop strategies for policy making as well as to raise awareness of the citizens. Some pioneering work has already been done world wide [2], [3], [4], [5]. As an input for the simulation, usually a building model in CityGML is used.
The use case is split into several parts: 

* open a website to display a 3D map using 3D Portrayal Service and select a polygonal area / district 
* query 3D building geometry inside the polygonal area from a CityGML data store using WFS 3.0 as an input to the simulation
* using 3D Portrayal Service and WFS 3.0 to query the simulation result and visualize it in a 3D scene by building Id, by address, and by polygonal area
* exend the use case to the INSPIRE 3D building module in addition to CityGML

The following aspects are covered by this use case:

_Check all categories that apply_

* [x] Querying features based on properties of related or nested objects or structured data types (one level)
* [x] Querying features based on properties of related or nested objects or structured data types (several levels)
* [ ] Querying features based on expressions built from complex predicates consisting of predicate groups and combinations of logical operators
* [x] Querying feature data and returning only parts of the features (selected properties, a single property only, etc.)
* [x] Querying feature data and returning additional features linked to the selected features
* [x] Access to and query of solid geometries and other geometries in a 3D CRS
* [x] Use of responses for display in a web browser
* [ ] Accessing different versions (including historic representations) of features

NOTE: Do we need more categories? Or another categorisation?

==== Data

* open  data 3D city model New York as used in Testbed 13 S3D performance. CityGML LoD 1/2 Building Model, no Textures
http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doitt/initiatives/3d-building.page; heating demand simulation is available (monthly energy balance) for Manhattan as "as is" simulation (simulated with SimStadt Software, HFT Stuttgart)
* open data 3D model of Essen as used in the Energy and Location Pilot of the JRC. CityGML LoD 1/2 Building Model, no Textures; heating demand simulation is available (monthly energy balance) as "as is" simulation, medium refurbishment scenario, advanced refurbishment scenario (simulated with SimStadt Software, HFT Stuttgart)
* open data 3D model of Essen, a test area converted from CityGML to INSPIRE building model using HALE Studio

===== open a website to display a 3D map using 3D Portrayal Service and select a polygonal area / district 

This has already been sshowcased and implemented in Testbed 13. The implemenetation is available here and can be further used and extended in Testbed 14 with the New York data set. A public demo is available at: tb13.igd.fraunhofer.de:8080/Apps/Sandcastle/index.html?src=3DPS_r.html&label=Showcases.

The following aspects are covered by this use case:

* [x] 3DPS getScene Region query

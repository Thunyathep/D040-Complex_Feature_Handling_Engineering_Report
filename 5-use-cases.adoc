== Use cases

=== Introduction

This section will document real-world use cases and requirements that more advanced feature
servers will have to support in the future, besides the essential capabilities
specified in Part 1 of the WFS 3.0 series.

The use cases will cover aspects like CityGML, CityGML ADEs, 3DPS, and WFS 2.0
interactions, but use other complex data schemas as background, too.

The following section is a use case template for discussion (text
in _italics_ has to be replaced).

////
To add a use case, copy `5-use-cases-TEMPLATE.adoc` and replace `TEMPLATE` by
a mnemonic id for the use case. Add an include statement.
